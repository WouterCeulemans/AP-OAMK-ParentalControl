                <h5>Childeren's privacy</h5>
                <p>
                    The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) gives parents control over what information websites can collect from their kids.  
                    The COPPA Rule — with new provisions in effect on July 1, 2013 —  puts additional protections in place and streamlines other procedures that 
                    companies covered by the rule need to follow.   If you run a website designed for kids or have a website geared to a general audience but collect 
                    information from someone you know is under 13, you must comply with COPPA’s requirements.  Questions?  Send them to CoppaHotLine@ftc.gov.

                <h5>Data Security</h5>
                <p>
                    Many companies keep sensitive personal information about customers or employees in their files or on their network.
                    Having a sound security plan in place to collect only what you need, keep it safe, and dispose of it securely can
                    help you meet your legal obligations to protect that sensitive data.  The FTC has free resources for businesses of any size.
